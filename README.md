### Aim:

To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for video generation.

---

### Algorithm:

1. Start by identifying and selecting AI video generation tools (Runway Gen-2, Synthesia, Pictory, DeepBrain).
2. Understand the basic functionality, strengths, and limitations of each tool.
3. Create **simple prompts** with general subject descriptions to generate base-level videos.
4. Refine prompts by adding **specific details** such as lighting, setting, background elements, and actions.
5. Enhance prompts by including **time and motion elements** (e.g., transitions, camera zoom, pacing).
6. Experiment with **different video styles** (cinematic, animation, artistic, realistic).
7. Review generated outputs and **iterate/refine prompts** for improved quality and consistency.
8. Generate **multiple versions** of the same prompt using variations in phrasing.
9. Save and compare all outputs to analyze how prompt changes affect final video generation.

### Procedure:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with Video Generation Models:** Explore Runway Gen-2, Synthesia, Pictory, and DeepBrain, noting their capabilities and limitations.
2. **Create Simple Prompts:** Example – “A person walking in a park.”
3. **Experiment with More Detailed Prompts:** Example – “A person in a red jacket walking along a sunny park path, with birds flying in the sky, and a dog running beside them.”
4. **Add Time and Motion Elements:** Example – “A time-lapse video of the sun setting over the ocean, with the camera slowly zooming out from a beach, capturing the waves and changing colors in the sky.”
5. **Test Different Video Styles:** Example – “An animated scene of a futuristic city at night, with glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a bustling crowd of people.”
6. **Iterate and Adjust Prompts:** Refine prompts by adding details such as camera angles and pacing.

   * Example – “A cinematic shot of a car speeding through a neon-lit city at night, with reflections on the wet street and a high-speed chase scene.”
7. **Generate Multiple Versions:** Try different phrasing of the same prompt to compare variations.
8. **Save and Compare Outputs:** Analyze all generated versions to understand prompt effectiveness.

### Result:

Thus, the experiment demonstrated how prompt design plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality AI-generated video outputs.
